Skateboarding is an interesting sport. According to a recent survey among teenagers in the USA, skateboarding was one of the ten most popular sports.
Many people believe that skateboarding first started in the early 1950s. A group of surfers in San Francisco made the first skateboard because they wanted to “surf” on dry land instead of surfing on water. These people’s names were unknown. Skateboarding was only a hobby until 1995. At that time, ESPN (a well-known sports channel) held the first Extreme Games (X Games) in Rhode Island, the USA, and first introduced skateboarding as an official sport.
If you want to try, you should buy a skateboard first. The main part of a skateboard is the deck, the piece of wood that you stand on. There are two trucks under the deck and each truck has two wheels. The second thing you should buy is shoes which protect your feet. Remember that if you are a beginner, you will definitely fall off a few times. Therefore, you ought to wear a helmet to protect your head when practicing.
Skateboarding helps strengthen your leg muscles and focuses your mind. Anyone can enjoy it. Take skateboarding seriously, practice hard, stay safe and you will love it.
