Dentists say that the most important part of tooth care happens at home. So, what should we do to have good oral health?
First of all, we should brush our teeth at least twice a day - after breakfast and dinner. To keep our teeth healthy, we should brush thoroughly for two minutes. Move the brush back and forth and make sure to clean the back, front and top sides of each tooth.
Second, among a lot of toothbrushes in the supermarket, we should choose a small-headed soft toothbrush. It can reach all areas of the mouth and doesnâ€™t harm our teeth and gums. We should also replace the toothbrush every three months.
Third, we should use mouthwash after brushing. Each tooth has five sides, but a toothbrush cleans only three of them. The mouthwash helps us clean teeth completely. Remember to spit it out.
Fourth, we should choose the best food for the health of our teeth which include cheeses, chicken or other meats, and nuts. These foods provide the calcium which helps strengthen the teeth. Some vegetables like garlic, ginger or pepper can be used as home remedies for a toothache. Try to avoid snacks, sugary foods or sodas.
Last but not least, we should visit our dentist at least every six months and every time that we have a problem with our teeth.
